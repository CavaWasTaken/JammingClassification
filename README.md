# Navigation Monitoring & Jamming Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) interference detection and classification**, specifically targeting jamming attacks that threaten navigation systems. The aim is to develop robust methods for identifying and classifying different types of jamming signals that can disrupt GPS/GNSS receivers.

## Objectives

- **Monitor GNSS signal integrity** by detecting anomalies and interference patterns
- **Classify jamming types** to distinguish between different interference sources and attack vectors
- **Generate datasets** for training and evaluating machine learning models on real or simulated GNSS signals
- **Enable robust navigation** by providing early warning systems for jamming detection

## Applications

This research has critical applications in:
- **Aviation and maritime navigation** - ensuring safe positioning and timing
- **Autonomous vehicles** - protecting navigation systems from intentional attacks
- **Critical infrastructure** - securing systems that rely on GNSS timing (telecommunications, power grids)
- **Defense and security** - detecting and mitigating adversarial interference

## Dataset

The project includes dataset generation tools and pre-generated datasets for GNSS signal analysis, focusing on both clean signals and various jamming scenarios. Due to the large size of the datasets (several GB), they are not included in this repository and should be stored locally or accessed separately.

## Context

This work is part of the **Navigation and Monitoring** course studies, exploring the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and satellite navigation security.
